# blockchain-backend

Both folders can be imported in a hyperledger-fabric test-envorinment and used like the example application in the hyperledger fabric documentation.

The application will not run the test functions according to the documentation, instead it creates an express api listener which then listen for requests which lead to the execution of the test function and return the output of them.

It can be used locally with the blockchain-frontend tool without any changes.
